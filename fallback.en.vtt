much better way it would be like here's
the<00:00:30.359><c> engine</c><00:00:30.480><c> now</c><00:00:31.080><c> let's</c><00:00:31.260><c> take</c><00:00:31.439><c> it</c><00:00:31.560><c> apart</c><00:00:31.800><c> how</c>

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
the engine now let's take it apart how
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.350 align:start position:0%
the engine now let's take it apart how
are<00:00:32.160><c> we</c><00:00:32.219><c> going</c><00:00:32.340><c> to</c><00:00:32.399><c> take</c><00:00:32.520><c> it</c><00:00:32.640><c> apart</c><00:00:32.880><c> oh</c><00:00:33.120><c> you</c>

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
are we going to take it apart oh you
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.790 align:start position:0%
are we going to take it apart oh you
need<00:00:33.480><c> a</c><00:00:33.600><c> screwdriver</c><00:00:33.960><c> that's</c><00:00:34.440><c> what</c><00:00:34.680><c> the</c>

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
need a screwdriver that's what the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
screwdriver is for you need a wrench
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 align:start position:0%
screwdriver is for you need a wrench
that's<00:00:36.239><c> what</c><00:00:36.360><c> the</c><00:00:36.480><c> wrench</c><00:00:36.719><c> is</c><00:00:36.840><c> for</c><00:00:37.020><c> and</c><00:00:37.620><c> then</c><00:00:37.920><c> a</c>

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's what the wrench is for and then a
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.770 align:start position:0%
that's what the wrench is for and then a
very<00:00:38.520><c> important</c><00:00:38.820><c> thing</c><00:00:39.000><c> happens</c><00:00:39.239><c> which</c><00:00:39.600><c> is</c>

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
very important thing happens which is
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 align:start position:0%
very important thing happens which is
that<00:00:40.079><c> the</c><00:00:40.320><c> relevance</c><00:00:40.680><c> of</c><00:00:40.920><c> the</c><00:00:41.100><c> tools</c><00:00:41.460><c> becomes</c>

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
that the relevance of the tools becomes
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
that the relevance of the tools becomes
apparent<00:00:42.360><c> so</c><00:00:42.840><c> ol5</c><00:00:43.379><c> boys</c><00:00:43.680><c> are</c><00:00:43.860><c> in</c><00:00:44.040><c> that</c><00:00:44.280><c> school</c>
